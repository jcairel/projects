# Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm to minimize the distance traveled by two trucks delivering to houses in a 35x35 grid. The algorithm starts with chromesomes of randomly generated routes and children
chromesomes are generated by swapping a random subarray of 2 parents randomly selected with probability relative to their fitness, where fitness is measured by the inverse of the total distance
traveled by the route given by a chromosome. There is also a chance of a chromosome in the population randomly mutating by swapping 2 random values in their route. At the end of every generation,
the population is trimmed down to it's original size, keeping only the fittest values in the population.
