# Projects
A collection of my more interesting class projects.
## Dolphin Classifier
A TensorFlow neural network to classify Pacific white-sided dolphins and Rissoâ€™s dolphins based on echolocation clicks.
## Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm to minimize the distance traveled by two trucks delivering to houses in a 35x35 grid.
## Multi-level Paging
A simulation of an operating system's hierarchical memory management with address mapping from virtual memory pages to physical memory.
## Ride Share
A simulated ride-share app with requests being concurrently generated and fulfilled using pthreads and semaphores to enforce mutual exclusion and where 
requests are communicated between producers and consumers through a bounded buffer struct shared between all active threads.
## Disassembler 
A program to disassemble SIC/XE object code back into assembly code.
